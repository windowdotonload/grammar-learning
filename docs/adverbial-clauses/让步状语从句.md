典型例题  
1） \_\_\_she is young, she knows quite a lot.　  
A. When　B. However　 C. Although　 D. Unless  
答案：C。意为虽然她很年轻，却知道许多。  
  
2)　as, though 引导的倒装句  
　 as / though引导的让步从句必须表语或状语提前（形容词、副词、分词、实义动词提前）。  
　　Child as /though he was, he knew what was the right thing to do.  
　= Though he was a small child, he knew what was the right thing to do.  
  
注意： a.　句首名词不能带任何冠词。  
　　　　b.　句首是实义动词，其他助动词放在主语后。如果实义动词有宾语和状语，随实义动词一起放在主语之前。  
　　 Try hard as he will, he never seems able to do the work satisfactorily.  
　 = Though he tries hard, he never seems…  
　虽然他尽了努力，但他的工作总做的不尽人意。  
  
3)　ever if, even though.　即使  
　　We'll make a trip even though the weather is bad.  
  
4) whether…or-　 不管……都  
　　 Whether you believe it or not, it is true.  
  
5)　"no matter +疑问词" 或"疑问词+后缀ever"  
　　 No matter what happened, he would not mind.  
　　 Whatever happened, he would not mind.  
　 替换：no matter what = whatever  
　　　　 no matter who = whoever  
　　　　 no matter when = whenever  
　　　　 no matter where = wherever  
　　　　 no matter which = whichever  
　　　　 no matter how = however  
　 注意：no matter 不能引导主语从句和宾语从句。  
　（错）No matter what you say is of no use now.  
　（对）Whatever you say is of no use now.  
　　　 你现在说什么也没用了。(Whatever you say是主语从句)  
　（错）Prisoners have to eat no matter what they're given,  
　（对）Prisoners have to eat whatever they're given.　囚犯们只能给什么吃什么。
