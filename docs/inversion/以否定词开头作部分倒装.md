答案D. 以具有否定意义的副词放在句首时，一般采用倒装句(谓语前置)。这类表示否定意义的词有never, seldom, scarcely, little, few, not, hardly, 以及not only…but (also), no sooner…than, hardly… when scarcely… when　等等。  
  
注意：只有当Not only… but also连接两个分句时，才在第一个分句用倒装结构。如果置于句首的Not only… but also仅连接两个并列词语，不可用倒装结构。  
　 Not only you but also I am fond of music.
