1)　 so… that 句型中的so 位于句首时，需倒装。  
　　 So frightened was he that he did not dare to move an inch.  
  
2)　在某些表示祝愿的句型中：  
　　May you all be happy.  
  
3)　在虚拟语气条件句中从句谓语动词有were, had, should等词，可将if 省略，把 were, had, should 移到主语之前，采取部分倒装。  
　 Were I you, I would try it again.  
  
典型例题：  
1） Not until the early years of the 19th century\_\_\_ what heat is　　  
A. man did know　 B. man knew　 C. didn't man know　 D. did man know  
答案为D.　否定词Not在句首，要求用部分倒装的句子结构。  
  
2） Not until I began to work \_\_\_ how much time I had wasted.　  
A. didn't I realize　　B. did I realize　　C. I didn't realize　D. I realize  
　答案为B。  
  
3)　Do you know Tom bought a new car?  
　I don't know, \_\_\_.  
　A. nor don't I care　 B. nor do I care　  
　C. I don't care neither　D. I don't care also  
　解析：答案为B.　句中的nor引出部分倒装结构，表示"也不"。由 so, neither, nor引导的倒装句，表示前一情况的重复出现。其中, so用于肯定句, 而 neither, nor 用在否定句中。
