# 原因状语从句

Sources: [Original Article](https://www.kekenet.com/grammar/1903.htm)

  
比较：because, since, as和for  
  
1）　because语势最强，用来说明人所不知的原因，回答why提出的问题。当原因是显而易见的或已为人们所知，就用as或 since。  
　 I didn't go, because I was afraid.  
　 Since /As the weather is so bad, we have to delay our journey.  
  
2）　由because引导的从句如果放在句末，且前面有逗 号，则可以用for来代替。但如果不是说明直接原因，而是多种情况加以推断，就只能用for。  
　 He is absent today, because / for he is ill.  
　 He must be ill, for he is absent today.
