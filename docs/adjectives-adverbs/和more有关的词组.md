典型例题  
1）The weather in China is different from\_\_\_\_.  
　A. in America　 B. one in America　 C. America  
　D. that in America  
答案：D. 本题意为"中国的天气比美国热。"比较的是天气而不是国家，C不能选。A没有名词，后句成分不全，排除。B和D中，B中的one常用来代替可数名词，而that可车以代替不可数或抽象名词，所以选D。

A. as twice many　　B. as many twice　　C. twice as many　D. twice many as  
　答案C. 此句意为"这个厂1988能生产的拖拉机是往年的两倍"。 表示倍数用"倍数+ as + 形容词原形+ as +比较对象"的句型。所以此句答案为C。  
　This ruler is three times as long as that one.
